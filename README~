Sedhead is just a header file i like to use in my programs. It covers various
functionalities via #defines.

Not everything in this header is of the same standard. For example, 
the free_all(...) macro is very C99 heavy. 
(variable length macros, and a couple compound literals)

All my code is documented via comments.
